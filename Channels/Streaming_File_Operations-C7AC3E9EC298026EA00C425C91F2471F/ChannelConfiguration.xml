   description="This channel shows some short examples of using file APIs in Lua which allow files to be read or written to in small chunks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This can be useful if you are processing large batches of data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rather than reading everything into memory at once you can read smaller sections at time. This can dramatically improve the performance of some interfaces."

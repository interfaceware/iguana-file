-- This example shows invoking a command line program on windows.  One of
-- the complications with windows is if you have multiple volumes
-- Iguana could be running on the C: drive and if you wanted to
-- run a program on the D: drive then you have do something like
-- "D:\ && cd D:\\Some Directory\\XYX\\ && MyCommand"
-- It can be very perplexing the first time you run into this.

-- Note that rather than using dir os.fs.glob is a better choice for reading
-- files from a directory. See:
